// Part I: Variables & Datatypes

//	a. Q & A

// 1. you assign value to a variable with an assignment operator - 
// i.e. an equals sign = . Put a value across an assignment operator
// from your variable, and it becomes the variable's value - 
// and they become essentially interchangable. 

// 2. you can't change the value of just any variable - 
// const, for example, can't be redclared, but let can!
// all you have to do is declare it afresh. 

// 3. you reassign the value? I think that's what you're asking

// 4. to declare a variable is to outline its structure and parameters 
//  - but not necessarily to assign those parameters  meaning/value - 
// within a given scope. 

// to assign a variable is to give it a specific value.
// This is done with an assignment operator, = . 

// to define a variable is to assess or display its value. 

// 5. psuedocoding is writing out, in language that's sort of 
// half way between proper english and javascript syntax, 
// a rough draft of your code. it's super useful for 
// planning what you'll actually code, as you can break 
// down steps and desired outcomes in a language that's 
// more familiar (probably) to you than straight javascript.
// 6. Hmm, I'm gonna say around 60 planning/40 coding?

// b. Strings

// 1. 

let firstVariable = 'Hello world';

firstVariable = 99; 

let secondVariable = firstVariable;

secondVariable = 'ibuprofin';

// <-- ibuprofin

// 2. 

const yourName = 'John'

console.log('Hello! My name is ' + yourName);

//c. Booleans

 const a = 4;
 const b = 53;
 const c = 57;
 const d = 16;
 const e = 'Kevin';

 console.log(a < b);
 console.log(c > d);
 console.log('Name' === 'Name');
 console.log(true !== false);
 console.log(false === false === false === false === false === false === true); // ok, I don't understand why this is true but it is?
 console.log(false === false);
 console.log(e === 'Kevin');
 console.log(a + b === c );
 console.log(a * a === d);
 console.log(48 == '48');
